In the CC folder there are the replacement score maps for the climate-smart prioritisation and in the no_CC those for the climate-naive.

In the 'biotyp' folder are all the results for prioritisations that include conservation features not split by ecoregion.
Viceversa in 'MEOW_and_biotyp' the conservation features were split by ecoregion. 

The value reported in the name of each file is the percentage used as a tradeoff to select climate-priority areas for each conservation feature (more on the method 'climate-priority areas' in Buenafe et al. 2023 - https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2852).

The folder 'mean' indicate that I am using a mean value of landward and seaward change in the prioritisation.
